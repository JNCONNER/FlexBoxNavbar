We will be creating one of the most widely made components! A Navbar!

The object of this exercise is to create a Navbar using Flexbox.

I have given you an image of the Navbar as your mock. We are trying to get it as close to the image as possible.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The navbar must extend the width of the screen
- There should be a Logo, or the word 'Logo', at the far left of the Navbar
- There should be 3 links in the navbar, each with its own text content (Home, Products, Services)
- There should be a Search input and a Search Button to the far right of the Navbar
